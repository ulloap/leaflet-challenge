# leaflet-challenge
## module15

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to map the coordinates of earthquakes in the past 7 days, and map them while including the magnitude and depth of each earthquake. 

### Steps
* A JSON link ["All earthquakes" in the past 7 days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) was used in order to pull the earthquake data.
* The library d3 was used in order to read all the data and save each feature.
* Functions were created in order to mark the depth and magnitude of each earthquake, by adding colors and size markers
* A legend shows the color scale for the map
* Each pop up displays the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake
